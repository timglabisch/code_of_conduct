# Code Matters Code Of Conduct

## definitions

### social opinion
A social opinion includes any kind of political, religious or gender specific statement.
This also includes ANY statements about ANY collaborator that is not technically relevant to the project.
A social opinion also includes ANY feelings about ANY collaborator (including yourself).
ANY response to ANY social opinion is by definition a social opinion.

Examples of social opinions: gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.


### collaborator
Everyone who contribute or try to contribute to the project.

### supervisor
Everyone who has merge access.

### the project
The project includes ANY work that is related to the project.
The project also includes ANY public communication about the project.


### Code of Conduct violation note
Every violation note is limited to just this statement:
;i-feel-bad-and-coc-saves-me;[E-MAIL OF THE COLLABORATOR YOU FEEL ATTACKED BY];

Violation notes *MUST NOT* contain ANY kind of explanations about the violation.

For non supervisors:
Every violation note *MUST* come with an E-Mail (at least 12h after adding the violation note) to coc@[project.org].
The E-Mail *MUST* at least contain:
- Link to the violation
- Explanation why YOU feel that this is a violation.
- Explanation why YOU are affected by this violation.

By sending the E-Mail you agree that a supervisor *CAN* (*NOT MUST*) contact you.
Every supervisor *IS ALLOWED* to share your explanation with the attacker and the community.

## Rules

### no social opinions
Project related work *MUST NOT* contain any social opinion.


### every form of gender / pronoun is allowed at any time and means exactly the same.
Everyone who interacts with the project *CAN* be addressed (in the context of the project) using *"he"*, *"she"* AND *"it"*.
*Every usage of any gender/pronoun is correct at any time* regardless of the gender the addressed feels like.

For example these sentences are valid to address any collaborator at any time:
I think his code doesn't work as expected.
I think her code doesn't work as expected.
I think its code doesn't work as expected.

The order of any gender / pronoun doesn't matter.
We believe that no collaborator is a more or less good collaborator.


### outside of the project, everyone is free
Everyone who interacts the project *MUST* respect the freedom of any project collaborator.
Every collaborator is free to share it's opinion (including social opinion) *WITHOUT ANY* restriction.
It's *NOT ALLOWED* to share any social opinions, in the context of the project. Even if you feel like a victim.

We believe that ignoring any kind of social statements is the best way avoid non technical conflicts between collaborators.


### discuss or debate the idea, not a collaborator.
Any kind of personal attack is *NOT ALLOWED*.
It's fine to not agree with a collaborator. It's *NOT ALLOWED* to note *ANY* kind of social opinion to ANY collaborator.
Argue for and against an idea is a constructive contribution but *MUST NOT* contain any social opinion.


### discuss or debate the technology around project, nothing more.
Every topic that is not directly related to the project is *NOT ALLOWED*.
Non technical conflicts *MUST* be discussed in a separate space.


### the project shares no non technical (including no social) opinions
Collaborators *MUST NOT* share any non technical ideas (especially no social opinions) in the name of the project.
The Project *MUST NOT* share non-technical ideas or values.


### no room for ambiguity
To avoid talking past each other, every collaborator *MUST* ensure writing in a non ambiguous way.


### no advice on collaborators
Collaborators *MUST NOT* take any kind of advice on other Collaborators.
It is *NOT ALLOWED* to tell any collaborator what he/she/it has to do.

Examples of *NOT ALLOWED* advice:
You should read this blog post.
You would understand it, if you would read this blog post.

Both of this sentences could be rewritten this way:
The idea i mentioned is described in this blog post.


### indication of violations
The code of conduct *MUST* only be discussed here: <link>
Disturbing the project is *NOT ALLOWED*.

If YOU feel affected by a violation against the code of conduct you're *LIMITED TO*:
- Add a code of conduct violation note.
- Ping a supervisor.

Supervisors are *ALLOWED* to:
- Add a code of conduct violation note, even if they don't feel like a victim of the violation.
- Close or drop the entire discussion.
- Remove any kind of code of conduct notes.
- Adding the statement "This is not a code of conduct violation." (without any explanation).

If a supervisor removed your code of conduct note or decided that there is no code of conduct violation,
you *MUST NOT* add another note related to the same topic.

You *MUST NOT* discuss any decision of any supervisor related to the code of conduct.
If you don't feel well on the decision of a supervisor, feel free to ask for a private chat.
