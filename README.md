# Code Matters Code Of Conduct

## definitions

### social opinion
A social opinion includes any kind of political, religious or gender specific statement.
This also includes ANY statements about ANY collaborator that is not technically relevant to the project.
A social opinion also includes ANY feelings about ANY collaborator (including yourself).
ANY response to ANY social opinion is by definition a social opinion.

Examples of social opinions: gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.


### collaborator
Every mammal (including humans) who contribute or try to contribute to the project.


### the project
The project includes ANY work that is related to the project.
The project also includes ANY public communication about the project.


## Rules

### no social opinions
Project related work *MUST NOT* contain any social opinion.


### every form of gender / pronoun is allowed at any time and means exactly the same.
Everyone who interacts with any project related work *CAN* be addressed (in the context of the project) using *"he"*, *"she"* AND *"it"*.
*Every usage of any gender/pronoun is correct at any time* regardless of the gender the addressed feels like.

For example these sentences are valid to address any collaborator at any time:
I think his code doesn't work as expected.
I think her code doesn't work as expected.
I think its code doesn't work as expected.

The order of any gender / pronoun doesn't matter.
We believe that no collaborator is a more or less good collaborator.


### outside of the project, everyone is free
Everyone who interacts with any project related work, *MUST* respect the freedom of any project collaborator.
Every collaborator is free to share it's opinion (including social opinion) *WITHOUT ANY* restriction.
It's *NOT ALLOWED* to share any social opinions, in the context of the project. Even if you feel like a victim.

We believe that ignoring any kind of social statements is the best way avoid non technical conflicts between collaborators.


### discuss or debate the idea, not the person.
Any kind of personal attacks is *NOT ALLOWED*.
It's fine to not agree with a collaborator. It's *NOT ALLOWED* to note *ANY* kind of social opinion of ANY collaborator.
Argue for and against an idea is a constructive contribution and *MUST NOT* contain any social opinion.


### discuss or debate the technology around project, nothing more.
Every topic that is not directly related to the project is *NOT ALLOWED*.
Non technical conflicts *MUST* be discussed in a separate space.


### the project shares no non technical (including no social) opinions
Collaborators *MUST NOT* share any non technical ideas (especially no social opinions) in the name of the project.
The Project *MUST NOT* share non-technical ideas or values.


### no room for ambiguity
To avoid talking past each other, every collaborator *MUST* ensure writing in a non ambiguous way.
