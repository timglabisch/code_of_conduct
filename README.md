# Code Matters Code Of Conduct

## definitons

### social opinion
A social opinion includes any kind of political, religious or gender specific statement.
This also includes ANY statements about ANY collaborator that is not technically relevant to the project.
A social opinion also includes ANY personal feelings about everyone (including yourself).
ANY response about ANY social opinion is by definition a social opinion.

Examples for social opinions are any kind of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## no social opinion
Project related work *MUST NOT* contain any social opinion.

## every form of gender / pronoun is allowed at any time and means exacly the same.
Everyone who interacts with any project related work *CAN* be addressed (in the context of the project) using *"he"*, *"she"* AND *"it"*.
*Every usage of any gender/pronoun is correct at any time* regardless of the gender the addressed feels like.

For example these sentences are valid to address everyone:
I think his code doesn't work as expected.
I think her code doesn't work as expected.
I think it's code doesn't work as expected.

The order of any gender / pronoun doesn't matter.
We believe that in the context of the project nobody is a more or less good human.

## outside of the project, everyone is free
Everyone who interacts with any project related work, *MUST* respect the freedom of any project collaborator.
Every collaborator is free to share it's opinion *WITHOUT ANY* restriction within it's local laws.
This includes any kind of statements about it's social opinion.
It's *NOT ALLOWED* to share any social opinions, in the context of the project. Even if you feel like a victim.

We believe that ignoring any kind of social statements is the best way avoid non technical conflicts in the community.
Because PHP is project, it can't have any kind social opinion (because projects can't).

## no personal attacks or any kind of insults
Any kind of blaming is *NOT ALLOWED*.
It's fine to not agree with someone, but it's *NOT ALLOWED* to blame any of it's social opinions.
Personal attacks are *NOT ALLOWED*, but it's *ALLOWED* to argument against any kind of project related ideas or project related technical decisions.

Argue against an idea or a technical decision is a constructive contribution and has nothing todo with the author of the idea or technical decision.

## the project shares no non technical opionion
Everyone who interacts with any project related work *MUST* ensure that it's don't share any non technical (especially no social) ideas in the name of the project.
The Project *MUST NOT* share non-technical ideas or values.

## no condescending advice
